      <h2>Who?</h2>
      <p>
        If there is one horror creator whose name should always be mentioned among the likes of Stephen King and George
        Romero, it is manga artist Junji Ito. Ito makes every potential page turn feel like a threat. You never know
        what horrifying sight youâ€™ll see next, but even then, no matter how revolting the image, you just cannot look
        away. His art though is only half of what makes him one of the all-time greats, as he is also able to
        effortlessly tap into our most subconscious fears. Every story of his feels like a nightmare,
        completely unrestrained by logic. So, with an anime adaption of his masterpiece Uzumaki on the way and another
        series just announced, now is the perfect time for an introduction to Junji Ito. The Ito hype train is about to
        leave the station.<a

    <h2>The Uzumaki</h2>
    <p>
      For those unfamiliar with the title, the story follows a young girl named Kirie and her friend Shuichi as they
      battle an infectious obsession with spirals plaguing their seaside town. The infection warps the mind and bodies
      of its inhabitants in all sorts of bizarre scenarios, eventually leading to the entire town being engulfed in a
      spiral pattern. Through Kirie and Shuichi paying constant witnesses to the decline of family, friends and
      community, the weight of knowing the truth of the doomed town makes them some of the few to combat the growing
      obsession.<a href="https://asianmoviepulse.com/2020/01/manga-review-uzumaki-1998-by-junji-ito/" target="_blank">
